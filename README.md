# Welcome to my Programming repository!

My name is Spyros. I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. In this repository, I will upload the code from problems that I solved for online machine learning challenges or during some very interesting online Machine Learning Courses. In the future, I may add more applications and machine learning problems.

You can find great Machine Learning courses in the following links. If you are interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc., I highly recommend you take these courses.
